 #1) Dijkshtra's algorithm fails for negative weight edges of graph
# 2) Time complexity for this SPT calculation is O(V^2) as we are appending one vertex in each
# cycle and in that each cycle we are finding minimum distance value in O(V) time
# 3)For graphs with negative weight edges, Bellmanâ€“Ford algorithm can be used
#4)The code is for undirected graph, same dijkstra function can be used for directed graphs also.
#5)Dijkshtra's algorithm is a greedy algorithm
